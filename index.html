    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 20th February 2026</p>

    <p>
      Daily Bible Verses – Worthy (“Worthy,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and your choices.
    </p>

    <p>By using Worthy, you agree to this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>A. Subscription Information</h3>
    <p>
      We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. When you purchase a subscription or lifetime access,
      the App Store provides transaction and subscription status information. We do not receive or store
      your payment card details.
    </p>

    <h3>B. Anonymous Usage Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      We use Supabase to collect limited, anonymous analytics to understand how the app is used and to improve the experience.
      This may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Feature usage</li>
      <li>Screen views</li>
      <li>App interaction events</li>
      <li>Subscription status events (e.g., started trial, active, cancelled)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This analytics data is intended to be non-identifying and does not include your name or personal identity.
    </p>

    <h3>C. Age Range (Aggregated Only)</h3>
    <p>
      During onboarding you may select an age range. We use this to understand aggregate distribution (counts by age range)
      to improve the app. We do not store your age range in a personal profile tied to you.
    </p>

    <h3>D. Crash Reports and Diagnostics</h3>
    <p>
      We may use Sentry to collect crash reports and technical diagnostics to improve stability. This may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system version</li>
      <li>App version</li>
      <li>Error logs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used only to troubleshoot issues and improve performance.
    </p>

    <h3>E. Content Stored on Your Device</h3>
    <p>
      Journal entries, saved verses, streaks, preferences, and your chosen display name (if you enter one)
      are stored locally on your device. We do not upload or store your journal content or display name on our servers.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you have iCloud device backup enabled, iOS may include app data as part of your device backup.
      This is controlled by Apple’s system settings and is separate from any in-app syncing.
    </div>

    <h3>F. Push Notifications</h3>
    <p>
      If you enable notifications, we may send reminders or encouragement messages. Notifications are optional and can be
      disabled at any time in your device settings.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or require:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account login credentials</li>
      <li>Contacts</li>
      <li>Photos or camera data</li>
      <li>Precise location</li>
      <li>Sex / gender information</li>
      <li>Payment card details (handled by Apple)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advertising Tracking</h3>
    <p>
      We do not currently use advertising tracking (such as IDFA-based tracking) or session recordings.
      If we add advertising measurement in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and, where required,
      request permission via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework.
    </p>
